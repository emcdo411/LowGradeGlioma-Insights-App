### Why This Matters

The prevalence of low-grade gliomas (LGG) continues to rise in young adults, and understanding treatment outcomes is crucial for providing effective care. Clinicians and administrators need access to real-time data that can inform decisions on surgical success, post-surgery treatments, and holistic approaches. This app offers both clinical insights and a robust technical framework, making it a valuable tool for improving the quality of care in hospitals.

By leveraging data visualization, the app provides insights into:

* **Incidence rates** of LGG in various age groups
* **Success rates** for surgical treatments across demographics
* **Post-surgery treatment outcomes**, including radiation and chemotherapy
* **Holistic approaches** like diet and lifestyle management

The app’s interactive elements also ensure that hospital executives and health admins can quickly assess critical metrics, optimizing operational decisions and treatment strategies.
